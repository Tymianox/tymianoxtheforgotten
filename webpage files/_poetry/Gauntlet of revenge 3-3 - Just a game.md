Stomp
Stomp
One after
The other

March forward into the void
My brethren of metal and mind of blood
Listen to the rhyme and forget who you are
Let the dead curate your lives

We shall stand side by side
My brethren with no eyes, ears or mouths
March forward! Trample the traitor!
Let no one escape alive!

You think it's just a game?
Then I'll show you what kind of game you play
When you treat friends like trifles to be forlorn
Think before pointing the blade
