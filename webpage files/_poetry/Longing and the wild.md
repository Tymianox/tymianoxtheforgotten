# Longing and the wild

27/07/25

I saw two wolves
One next to the other—
White looked with longing,
Gray with weary anger.

I wanted to take a photo,
As memory of this day,
But the weary wolf growled,
So I did not overstay.

I walked through the forest
Toward the city edge.
The white wolf followed me,
The gray followed his pledge.

Among the dark alleys,
I turn myself around
To see the white wolf—
Still following behind.

I bring her back.
She does not belong.
She wants to buy sweets,
But I don't let her prolong.

Back at the edge,
The gray wolf awaits,
Unhappy yet not angry—
It could not enter the gates.

I tell them to go back to the wild;
In the city only pain will they find.
White disagrees, wants to stay by my side—
I take a photo of us to give her peace of mind.
