i know we're both just messing around
pretending to know the world
pretending to be whole
but please look into my eyes
and tell me

if a train was coming
would you care to move
if the ground were to crumble—
away under your feet
would you even notice
or would it be another day to you
if the sky was falling
would you raise you head to see
or if somebody stabbed you
would it hurt more than you already do
and if a bomb were to explode 
would you run away
or cover it to save everyone else

i love you
but i know we both drive—
over the speed limit
when angels cry in the sky
and i know and understand 
why you sometimes sit down in the shower
tears mixing with bloody water

i want to sit next to you and cry too

so if a train was coming
please move
for me
not for you
