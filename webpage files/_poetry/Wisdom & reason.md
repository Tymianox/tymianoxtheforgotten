Ripe specimen all around

Nobody make a sound

Long fallen from the tree

Never too far out in the field

Wisdom — they say —

And reason they speak

So why do I seem to be

The most astute mind

Assumption and bias

Baked in every word

Gloating in one

Loathing in the next

No place for thought

No place to ponder

Only go forward

Remember the old order 

The new is waking

The old a lesser evil

Don't try to adapt

They have to quadrate

  

Sit at the table

Eat what you've been given

Listen to the words

Sharpened in curare

Don't make a sound

They will not listen

Close your ears

For your heart to keep beating 

Nod and smile — that's what's required

Rot and die — that is what will happen
