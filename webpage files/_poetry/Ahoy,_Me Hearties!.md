   *"There once was a ship that put to sea
   The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea"*

Ye might 'e wonderin'
What's that whaler
Over yonder
Course 'tis the Billy o' Tea
Why's it washed up?
Arrright let me tell ye a tale
Of its last battle

   *"She'd not been two weeks from shore
   When down on her a right whale bore
   The captain called all hands and swore
   He'd take that whale in tow

   *"For forty days or even more
   The line went slack then tight once more
   All boats were lost, there were only four
   But still that whale did go*

   *"As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
   The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone
   The Wellerman makes his regular call
   To encourage the captain, crew and all"*

The truth us reached, all crew was dead
But one survivor without a leg
His tale was short but full of respect
For the whale that sank their collect

About two moons after they went in tow
The whale had dived deep down below
But soon on the other side would show
Only to upturn their ship in whole

They were deserted on an icey isle
Except the one survivor I named before
Who was in luck so it appears
To have been saved by another crew
