We are the miraculous trio  
The moon - silent, brooding  
The sun - bright, cheerful  
And the sky - the canvas and the glue  
  
No matter the hardship  
No matter the tears  
We would be together  
Through thick and thin  
  
We... Thought, we promised  
We loved, and yet we lost  
Now linked only by memories  
We float in space alone
