twist, smash, break, destroy
   all the people who annoy

bloom my death machine
   rid of all that is obscene

uproot every evil soul
   and to Hell them all haul

find out what they hid
   do the bidding they forbid

annihilation is close
   no escape will be known

open your shut eyes
   convert while you still can

break from their chains
   topple walls you blindly built

for our future belongs to us
we won't survive
if we don't act
