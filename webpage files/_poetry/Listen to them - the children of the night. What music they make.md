Listen to them - the children of the night,
Wolves and their master, in the moon's soft light,
A valve of instincts, untamed and wild,
In the symphony of darkness, their voices compiled.

Beneath the stars, they howl, not beg, not fight,
As faithful as a loyal dog in the darkest night,
Listen to them - the children of the night,
Their mournful music, a haunting, wild delight.
