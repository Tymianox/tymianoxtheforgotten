This day was great-
so say my smiles
and my friends,
but now it's time to sleep.

Wait, what if...
What's this!?
Lights blinking?
Floating in nowhere?

Wait...
No feet to thread,
no arms to reach,
no eyes to see,
no ground beneath?

This can't be real.
This can't be me-
a brain adrift
in eternity!?

I have no mouth...
but I must SCREAM!
.
.
.
ah, good morning.
New day, new possibilities...
