I'm lost in the things of my browser
I'm lost in the depths of my mind
I'm lost in a river of sadness
My life took a different turn

My thoughts are a whirlwind of madness
My mind is an alien creation
The turmoil of feelings and thoughts
Never for any reason stops

What if I'm an unfinished AI
What if I was made to find

the meaning of life
