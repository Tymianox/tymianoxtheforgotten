Remember how I always said
I hope it'll rain
So you'd stay longer
Alongside me
And sometimes it rained
And sometimes it did not
But either way I was happy 
Cause I still had you

But today...
I no longer wish for rain
For the clouds to grow heavy
With our prayers and sorrows
Today I wish for thunder
So I don't hear your voice
