In the pages of my soul, emotions inked and bound,
Locked in a diary, in turmoil, upside down.
Denial's whispers softly echo through the night,
Anger's fiery crown, refusal to yield to the light.
Depression's heavy weight, in shadows it drowns,
Bargaining with destiny, for reasons to relent,
Acceptance, the gentle grace, where the heart finds its peace.
