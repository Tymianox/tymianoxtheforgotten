#poetry/series/seven-deadly-sins 

You feel a sudden pull

On your heart -

Left, right

Front, back -

Someone's ripping it out,

Or is it you?

  

Remember how your friend

Got a new phone?

Remember how your neighbor 

Got a new car?

Remember how your parents

Got a new house?

  

You couldn't bear the thought,

They are better than you.

They shouldn't.

You work so hard,

You do everything right,

You should have it all.
