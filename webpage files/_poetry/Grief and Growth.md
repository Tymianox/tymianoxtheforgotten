We were stunted at a young age
Filled to the brim with grief and pain
And the grief won't shrink
or go away
It will stay
and hurt like hell
Tears will continue to fall
like gentle autumn rain
We will still struggle to live
every single day
But we learn anew to dream 
And if we survive this horror
One day we will bloom
more beautiful than all
