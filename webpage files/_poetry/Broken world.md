Why's it always the job of one man
To fix the world others've broken
Why is most humanity blind
To all that's wrong with mankind
Why do we turn a blind eye to
The suffering, the pain and the cries
Why do we stay silent and still
When the world needs love, kindness and will

Why do we let the darkness grow
When a little light can help it glow
Why do we choose to ignore
The problems that will come to our door
It's time for us to rise and unite
And bring back the peace and the light.
