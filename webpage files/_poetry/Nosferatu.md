They roam the night,
Put us in fright.
Not easily fended off,
They simply - scoff.
No weapon shall save
You. Only a lathe
To you will be of help.
Bring down a shelf,
Make wooden stakes -
Now high are stakes.
Put aside all the flake,
Make no mistake.
Cobble up a mini-gun,
And go to town!
Take that you pale bastards,
Now you're a buncha cowards.
