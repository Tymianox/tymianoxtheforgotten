We are scared of the apocalypse.
A cold, dark, permanent eclipse.
Terrified of a machine uprising.
For a volcanic winter preparing.

But there's one thing we forget,
We are the worst beings as of yet,
To live on this beautiful planet,
And still we constantly lose sight of it.

In the end we'll die to our own kind.
To bullying, hate, idiotism, homicide,
Malice, injustice, jealousy, spite.
No machine will hurt us if we do it right.
We can survive all matter of hardship,
Thanks to our ingenuity and companionship.
It's our nature that'll kill us,
There is no escaping that.
