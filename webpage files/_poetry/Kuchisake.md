Darling, my love  
Do you like it when I smile?  
Come for a kiss  
Let's have some fun  
  
You don't mind the teeth  
The jagged edge, right?  
Mind if I test their sharpness?  
Joking, I know you don't mind  
  
Let's dance under the stars  
In this twisted, grim night  
Your blood is sweeter still  
When bathed in moon's light
