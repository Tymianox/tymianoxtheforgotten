Some days
I can't help myself
Thinking about worlds that could have been
In the stead of ours
Lost in Time and Space

The victorian reality
Powered by coal and steam
Water and Air, Earth and Fire
Steam cars, steam trains
Steam powered clocks and gizmos
Maybe even
A steam internet?

Or the vaguely vapourwave
World of purple electronic sunsets
With glitchy Windows 3.1
The refuge of VHS enthusiasts
Only missing the sense of life

Maybe a cyberpunk world
Where tech merges with flesh
Where everyone dreams of electric sheep
Watched by glass eyes of cameras
But at least safeguarded from the worst threats

Weirdly nostalgic sovietwave
A promised world where everyone has
And no one needs
With everyone equal
No one will take more than they need
Right?
