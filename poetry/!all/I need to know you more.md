I need to know how your name lingers on my tongue
I need to know what you love —
and hate
and I… stillneedtoknowyoumore

I need to know your heartbeat beneath my hands
I need to know how you laugh —
and cry
and I… stillneedtoknowyoumore

I need to know how you smell when you wake up
I need to know what you do —
and where you go
and I… stillneedtoknowyoumore

I need to know how you RUN
how you FALL
how you SCREAM
how you BLEED…
AND.
HOW.
YOU.
die.
