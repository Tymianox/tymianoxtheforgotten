Walking through ruins,
Finding memories once lost
To the depths of time,
Like letters in a ghost town's post.

Putting together pieces.
Doing rounds through the rubble,
Where critters made homes,
To find just trouble.

Kicking up clouds of thick dust,
Tripping on a left behind,
Family portrait,
Now left unentwined.
