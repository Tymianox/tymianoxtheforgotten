i must go, love
don't search for me in the fog
don't waver your faith in my love
don't think another i visit tonight 

waits for me the forest clan
i must join them for the ritual
and if i don't come back darling
my brother will replace me by your side

and when summer comes
go out, find a field of grain
and kiss it on your knees
for i'll be living in the ears of grain
