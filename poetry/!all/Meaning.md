My emotions are soaked
In tears of light
Don't know what to do with my life
It's all meaningless unless U give it one
Our life is the start of our demise

We're just a soup of atoms
With a bunch of ohms
We're an absurd speck
In the scale of cosmos
Our lives have no point
Even with our forces joint

Life appeared out of nowhere
Without any importance
The reality of it all
Makes no sense at all

But,

In our lives we've countless
Possibilities and routes
To our destination of death
We may be nothing
But we create something

Our lives will have finished
The universe will come to an end
And our work will be of no point
But we would have made our point
