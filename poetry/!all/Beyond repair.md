# Beyond repair

14/04/25
![[poem-beyond_repair.jpg]]https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/5113704

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life? 

Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die? 

'Cause I feel like that every fecking day

A permanent suspension between Life and Death

Hell and Earth

  

I've tried pills, narcotics and meds

But no matter what I feel exactly the same

No amount of love, sex and trains

can fill the emptiness. I think I'm another kind of broken

Beyond repair
