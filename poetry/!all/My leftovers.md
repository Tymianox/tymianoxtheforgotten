They wanted me to change
So I'm changing
One chip at a time
I will carve out of myself a better being
Even in worst materials parts can be beautiful
I'll get to them one way or another
And I will bring them out for all to see
All the chips I'll send back to God
Asking for a refund even though I
Left the best parts for myself
He knows what he did and the price he'll pay
