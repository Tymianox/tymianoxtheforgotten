# gods in the heavens / listen to my prayer

06/05/25

gods in the heavens 
or wherever you are
listen to my prayer
at least this one time
let me live happier
than I am right now
or end my suffering
today or tonight
do not play dirty
no hidden buts
listen to my prayer
at least this one time

gods in the heavens 
or wherever you are
I do not follow you
but I have open arms 
show me a mercy 
and I'll be your slave
I think my price is right
for eternal praise
gods in the heavens 
or wherever you are
listen to my prayer
at least this one time
