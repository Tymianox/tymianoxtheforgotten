My doctor said to take the pills
He did not say what they did
I'm already dead so I might as well
But this I did not expect

The side effect of said pills
(Saying it just gives me chills)
Is "lowering of sexual drive"
So I'm an asexual now

I don't actually mind it much
Except now I have blue balls such
That nothing makes the itch feel scratched
And all things sexual feel detached

So now I kinda float apart
My mind and body themselves depart
In opposite directions they run away
And I can't solve this riddle in any way
