#poetry/series/the-hayworth-tarot

He tilled the land in his youth

Now his mind is sprouting fruits

Earth still clings to his heated skin

Hairs mingle with roots thick and thin

Ruler of the bloom and rot 

  

Cup King calls him weak 

Wand King calls him aimless

Sword King calls him lost

But he listens only to the rain
