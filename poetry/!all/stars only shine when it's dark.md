stars only shine when it's dark

flowers only bloom in spring

animals only mate when they're in heat

and you have time for everything

  

find your night

find your spark

go deep in the forest

where only fireflies shine

  

there you may find your light

the fireflies will lead you to the skies

there you will know what's right

they'll guide you to find your purpose within
