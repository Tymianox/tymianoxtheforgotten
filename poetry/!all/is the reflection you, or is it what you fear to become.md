what do you seek in the mirror?

a simple commodity or something more?

I know your gaze evades windows—

is what they show something faux?

  

do you see something I don't?

a reflection of your soul?

what they show, do you bemoan?

do you find yourself abhor?

  
  

you ask what I see...

yet you haven't asked yourself.

I escape from a reality—

what do you think of your future self?

  

the window whispers truths,

the mirror dares not speak—

you don't have the right to disapprove,

you can't escape a conceite.
