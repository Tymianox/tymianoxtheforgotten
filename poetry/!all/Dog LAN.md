I think there's something different
About my ethernet cable
Lately I've noticed the noise it makes
Sounds a bit like barking
I bought it second hand
So maybe it's just that
Although I don't think it should make 
Any sounds

There's another thing I noticed
Wherever the paint is scratched off
I see something blinking
And I don't think it's an optical cable
But I'm no expert

The manufacturer's name also
Gives me some thought
Why would they call themselves
"Dog LAN"?
