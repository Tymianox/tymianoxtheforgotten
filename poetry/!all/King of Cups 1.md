The king

The ruler

The foundation

The savior 

He keeps the peace

Looking over everyone

With his mind's eye

Treasuring every soul

Every subject has their role 

To play in the king's plan

The bedrock of the sea

And yet liquid in his being

The meaning of peace

Only guardian of the people

Every subject has their role 

Role to play in his plan

  

Pentacle King calls him stagnant

Wand King calls him aimless

Sword King calls him lost

But he listens only to the waves
