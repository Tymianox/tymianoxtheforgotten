When you read a book
You embrace it's outlook
Immerse yourself in rich
And touching worlds

You become the main character
Experiencing otherworldly wonders
Whenever you are angry or sad
You can hide under their wings 

And the stories never die
Evolving as you grow
New chapters appearing
From brain's undergrowth
