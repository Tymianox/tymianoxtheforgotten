##### Part I

The day was gloom and dark, clouds reigned in the sky, as the cold wind caressed dying leaves. The streets lay empty - without a soul nearby, only wavering streetlights flickered, sending distress calls in Morse code. The journey home had blurred into a fleeting vision, lingering only as a phantom after waking. For weeks it felt as if the world itself had grown weary, lethargy creeping like a silent ill, apathy settling in.

At last, he found himself stood at the door, yet it's familiar frame felt like a threshold to another realm - dimly lit, cold, as if touched by winters hand. He stepped inside where silence ruled in absence of life, and a chill settled into his bones as he fumbled with the thermostat. He threw his weathered rucksack onto the bed, uncaring, and turned on a hot shower. For a brief, unsettling moment, the edges of reality seemed to blur, and a strange detachment sank in, as if he were drifting in a space where time unraveled and self dissolved.

With the shower finished, he stepped out into the cool air and dressed quickly, eager to chase away the lingering shivers. It was time to eat. Leftovers from the night before didn’t sound so bad—at least, no effort they required. He drifted through the kitchen, his movements slow, and stared blankly at the microwave. Minutes ticked by without him even realising, time leaking away like water down the drain.

He killed the lull by reaching for his phone, scrolling through social media, numbly absorbing the curated lives of others. Yet even this seemed distant, as if his mind was wrapped in fog and his senses could only grasp at faint echoes of reality. And there it is again, a shadow, dark and flickering, right on the edge of his vision. It clung to the dim corners of the room, an omen of things he'd rather not think about, dissipating before he could look at it. A chill crawled up his spine—*ding*. The foods done. Each bite tasted bland, a texture more than a flavour, and he found himself chewing mechanically, barely noticing as the food disappeared from the plate.

The weight of the day seemed to press in around him. The house was too quiet, too still, as though it held its breath in anticipation. The air felt thicker, somehow, as if it resisted his every step. He turned on the television, hoping to dispel the oppressive silence, but the sound seemed muted, as though swallowed by the walls. Shadows in the room seemed to stretch and tremble, shivering at the corners of his vision. He could almost hear something, singing? Just beneath the hum of the static.

He focused on the screen, but the image seemed distant and unreal. The figures moved in jerky motions, like marionettes dangling from unseen strings. His eyes began to ache, his vision blurring at the edges. He tried to look at the time, but his body refused to obey, rooted in place, demanding that he stare at the screen—demanding that he watch.

A knock at the door, postman's here, a bit late today. Nothing for him, as usual. He took his headphones, cranked up the volume and drifted away to sleep, his dreams filled with dark shapes, hoarse voices and poetry of all things.

##### Part II

The next morning arrived like a smudged reflection of the day before, a hollow echo that left him feeling more worn. He moved through his routine like a puppet, each motion mechanical and dull. Breakfast held no flavour, only a gritty texture clinging onto his tongue, dissolving into nothing before he could even recall what he'd eaten. His mother’s voice drifted from the kitchen, distant and indistinct, words blurred as though spoken underwater.

Outside, the world was cloaked in the same muted browns and greys, the sky heavy and overcast, casting everything in a sickly pallor. The street lay empty, the faint hum of traffic and faraway voices barely reaching his ears, swallowed by the thick, oppressive silence clinging to his skin like something alive. It felt as if he was the only real thing in an endless, dim world of echoes.

When he finally reached the school, he hesitated at the entrance, his skin prickling with a nameless apprehension. The familiar hallways seemed warped, the fluorescent lights casting long, unnatural shadows that stretched and distorted as he walked. Faces drifted past—his classmates and teachers, yet each one seemed new to him like a stranger's. Their eyes were hollow, unfocused, as though their minds were elsewhere, lost in some distant place he could never reach. Or was that him?

He stumbled into his classroom, his legs heavy, his vision blurring slightly as if a thick fog lay over everything. The room lay darker than memory, shadows thickening in the corners, pooling like spilled ink beneath dim, failing light. He slumped into his seat, barely noticing the scrape of the chair against the floor, and opened his notebook, staring blankly at the empty page.

Then, just out of the corner of his eye, he saw it—a dark, still shape curled up in the far corner of the classroom, indistinct yet impossibly clear. His heart raced, a cold sweat breaking over him as he tried not to look directly at it. Ignore it, he told himself, it’s nothing, just a trick of the light. But the figure didn’t fade; instead, it seemed to shift, as if... crying? He could swear he hear it's sobbing.

When he glanced away and looked back, the figure didn't fade—it shifted, almost imperceptibly, as if trapped and whimpering in the dark. Then he noticed—it wasn’t alone, the whole room was swelling with creatures, tall, short, human and animal-like, each jagged in a way he could not understand, each in a shadow cocoon. And then, they all began to smile, smile a twisted, blank smile that bared too many teeth. And then, he heard the whispers, the laughter, the curses—in a language unknown to him, unknown to the world. He wanted to scream, run, grovel at least, but his body did not respond, frozen, rooted in place as if held by an unseen force.

The bell rang, shattering the silence, and he blinked, the shadows vanishing as quickly as they had appeared. But the feeling lingered, a coldness that seeped into his bones, a sensation that something dark was watching, a patient predator, waiting for their prey. He glanced down at his notebook, and there, on the blank page, was a single word scrawled in shaky letters—*Hello*.

And then everything went black.

##### Part III

And then it came back. Grey. Only grey.

He was standing in the middle of a freeway, cars streaking past him as if he was nothing but mist. He tried to move, to scream, to run—but his body refused, a statue abandoned on the road. Not even a finger twitched.

Then, something shifted. His limbs began to move, but not where he wanted—not off the road, not back home. They followed the sickly white lines below, as if tethered to an invisible path. He blinked and there they were—the creatures, again, grinning from the shadows with their hollow, unseeing eyes. Another blink, and they changed. They became people—silent, faceless figures, each one with tears streaming down hollow cheeks, staring at him with compassion… or maybe pity.

His body jerked forward, then began to run, faster than he ever could—faster than the cars, faster than light.

White.

Everything was white.

And silent.

And then, white and silent became chaos.

Billions of images. Millions of voices. Shrieking, wailing, crying out from all around. A cacophony without end, pulling him deeper, further, antil he was lost within it.
