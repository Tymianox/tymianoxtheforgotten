In the cold depths of forgotten catacombs
a new monster awakens
It's steps echoing in the empty
damp & dark hallways

On It's forehead - the mark of the Beast
On It's back - scratched out - Aramaic verses

The new monster doesn't know
where It came from
or what It is
but It knows It is hungry

And so It roams the catacombs
in search of food


When It comes across a creature
cowering in the corner
The monster doesn't know
what this creature is
but It knows it is afraid

And so It devours it
shattering it's bones
and tearing it's flesh

The monster doesn't feel guilt
or remorse
It doesn't know how to feel

All It knows is that It is hungry
and that It will continue to hunt
until It is satiated


From It's mouth pour forth
a torrent of foul words
curses & blasphemies
against the human kind

The monster is malevolent
and It thirsts for blood

Its eyes glow red with hatred
And in Its hand It holds
a sharpened blade

The new monster is coming
and It will bring death
and destruction
in Its wake

Let's hope It never escapes the
Catacombs
