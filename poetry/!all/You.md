You threw us under the bus
Disappeared like a ghost
You stabbed us in the back
Like the scoundrel you are

You turned a meadow with few thorns
Into a field of roses that'll never bloom
You took our blood to satiate your thirst
And left us in a ditch where we hung out

You heartless monster
Or with heart made of stone
You left us to rot
After fattening us up
