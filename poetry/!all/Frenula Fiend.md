I'm sure you've heard of it -
The Frenula Fiend 
But I had to see

The whispers spoke of fleshy threads
A mouth that housed a thousand webs
With each frenulum a bridge 
Of detail disgusting to me

It's eyes like mirrors - twinkled with glee
Reflected all the strings in me
It's tongue - a spider in the web
Moved unsettlingly with no sense

But that was not it all
It's body strung with frenula all
In places you could not dream
Flesh to flesh tethering

It's body creaked and snapped
With flesh dangling all around
It smiled, or tried - it's maw too full
Of secrets caught in frenulas' pull

"Why seek me out?" The creature hissed
"Now you'll leave with more than you had wished"
And I turned away, but not unmarked
It's tentacle latched in my own heart

Now all thoughts feel taut, confined
My own controlled by fiendish mind
Beware you of this creature foul
Do not seek it - nothing good you will find
