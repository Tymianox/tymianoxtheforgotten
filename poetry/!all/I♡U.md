My life's a mess
Worse then chess
But with You
I might just get through

Your eyes let me forget
The things I've done and said
In Your voice
I find rejoice

You're the reason I'm full of life
Thanks to you I feel alive
When I'm close to You
I have worries few

Please don't leave me alone
When I need you the most
I'm sure that together with You
I can make it through
