We've been told of <span class="zalgo">e̷͇̓͜l̵̘͚̙͇͉̫͠͠ď̵̡̳͔̑͆̋̌r̷̛͓͉͓̹̲͒̃̊̔͝ͅí̵͔̔̓̿c̵̢̰̞͌h̵̨̨̛̼͈̞̤̖͖̩̾͛̊̃͝ͅ</span> creatures
Older than the universe itself
We treated them as gods
For their power was beyond
Our measly weak brains

They didn't even notice us
For we are too small to concern Them
But we still worshipped Them
And offered bloody sacrifices to Them
To not be destroyed by Them

We are nothing to Them
To small to notice
To small to concern
Not worth even an afterthought
Parasites on our own Mother
We. Are. Below. Them.
We. Are. Nothing.

We are to Them
What ants are to us
We don't notice them
Sometimes we step on one
But we don't care about it

But,
Like with ants

There are some who are curious
There are some who are sadistic

The greatest one of them all
Gorefield
