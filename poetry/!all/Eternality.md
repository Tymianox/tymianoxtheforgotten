A world without death
Is a world without fun
Full of boredom
Under a fa√ßade
Of endless pasttime

Are you sure you want to live without time
Wouldn't the weight of your mistakes bring you down?
Where would your motivation come from
When you'd've endless amounts of time
Even if your friends stay at your side
The universe will slowly die
What will you do then? Weep? Curse?
How long can you keep yourself entertained
In the eternal darkness that follows
How long can you keep yourself same?
