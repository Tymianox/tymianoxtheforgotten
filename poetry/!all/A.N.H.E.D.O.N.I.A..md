![poem-anhedonia](../!art/poem-anhedonia.jpg)


All I see is black
Not a light in sight 
Hate this feeling inside
Ever feel like not being alive?
Do your best, and feel your worst
Once brought up, then kicked down thrice 
Not a light in sight, nothing breaks thought the mask
I don't know what to do anymore, I don't even know how to live
And all I can do is lay, with head spinning, with thoughts squirming, alone
