I am terrified
My heart is struggling to beat right now
I fear losing the person I love
I fear losing the reason I'm alive
One wrong step can break it all
One wrong step and I'll end it all
Why am I broken, WHAT have I DONE?
I don't want to lead a life of this kind



There's no point in crying
It won't fix my brain
But I still do
It's better than not feeling at all
