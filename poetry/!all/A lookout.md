A lookout stood,
far not from my home.
I walked past it
every single day.

Seasons go past.
It stands there unused,
forgotten by
everyone but me.

In spring rains fell,
the wood swelled from them.
A thunderstorm
hit it, but not split.

Then summer came.
Scorched it till it was
dry as tinder.
Strain didn't take it down.

Autumn said "Hi".
Leaves a carpet made.
A beaver took
one of it's four legs.

In winter's hug
the lookout stood out,
but didn't fall down
under heavy blows.

Decades went past,
the lookout still stands,
without a leg,
but just not yet dead.
