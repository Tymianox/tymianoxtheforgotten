Dress your blade!

Prepare for battle!

Make your braid!

No more prattle!

  

Raise your dories brothers!

Scream out our war cry! 

On my mark we go forth! 

Run into to fires of war!

  

Steel shall clash!

Blood will splatter!

Through the ashes!

Our hearts won't shatter!

  

Remember brothers! 

We die with honor! 

We make our people proud! 

We stand as one, unbroken, loud!
