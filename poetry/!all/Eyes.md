In the depths of space
A creature resides
Known as "The All Eye"

He sees all
But cannot be seen
Your eyes belong to him
And he'll take them
When he's displeased

A ritual has been devised
To keep him away from us
His captors known as Icares

Once he was an average man
A bit jealous - to be honest
But loved by all that knew him

He married a young woman
A lovely pair they were
But that's where it all started
It's only downhill from here

His wife had a tendency
To meet tea toopers
The man in his jealousy
Asked Demons for help
A deal's been made
His soul to be enslaved

The Gods were not happy
With his mischief
They debated long
Too long
For Lord God's patience
He smited the man down
And made him into this
Because he wanted to see all
He made his eyes see All
All that is
All that was
All that will be

When the End comes
Make sure
To look after your eyes
Or he'll use them
