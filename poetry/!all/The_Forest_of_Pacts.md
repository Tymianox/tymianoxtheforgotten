I found myself on the edge of a forest
A magnificent tree stood before my eyes
It must have been taller than fourscore my height
The leaves in its crown calmly moved with the wind
Whispering - about other travellers before me

Beneath it a narrow path outset, barely a foot wide
I knew it slithered through the whole forest
Even though - I never saw it afore
The silence was broken by a birds cry
Cut off by an atrocious outcry

"I... I must go into it, it is calling upon me." 
With confidence I said, and immediately
Took a step back scared of what's to come
"If I don't, my sister... will breathe her's last."

Just as I entered it's welcoming shade
All my fear fled, like a flock of birds
When they see a seasoned falconer

The Forest - Myslevyr was its name - felt mysterious
There was something... unnatural about it
I felt as if it was alive, but not alive like flora or fauna
It seemed to... have a mind of its own
Is it a thing from another world?

The sun was slowly setting and I was tired
I decided to camp for the night near a spring cold

When I was in the middle of making my lair
I picked up a crackle to my side - without thinking
I dropped to the ground and towards it crawled

From behind a bush I saw three creatures - half man
Half goat - gathered around a campfire
My body decided for me - I ran
Ran as fast as I could, as far as I could
Making sure to still follow the path
Taking my half-made bed with me
Hoping the creatures would not look for me
In tomorrow's sun's radiant blaze

In the morning I woke up to the sound of a wolf's howl
Thankful that the creatures didn't decide
To make me an empty vessel without a soul

The path started slowly creeping upwards
And the tree branches began to get denser
Now the forest whole was full of eerie sounds
I started to worry if I will be able to come back

I spent a week in this forest, learning it's ways
Keeping my distance from everything
I did not understand

And on that faithful day I reached a river
With a tree slumped over it
My mind numb - I started climbing it
And then I heard it right next to me - 
The growl I was hearing for the week past

Scared out of the living daylights
I slowly turned my head
Straight into its grinning face
Terrified to the core, my mind went blank

I woke up on the ground, unable to move
Thinking I was paralyzed I awaited
The monster's return
But after a while I regained control
Grateful to all the gods, I swam through the river
Not even worrying about what may have lurked below
And continued my journey to the other side of the forest


After a year or so of going in circles I exited the forest
Right next to the tree I first saw
With my sister long gone
And no one else home
There's nothing here worth my time
I think I might go back
To live out the years I still have
In the place that took my life
And who knows?
Maybe I'll find where it leads
All the poor, lost souls
