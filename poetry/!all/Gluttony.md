You can't stop yourself,

Your body moves on its own.

Consume, consume, CONSUME!

Don't dare stop,

You have to consume.

Without consuming you are nothing.

NOTHING.

CONSUME.

Dreadful.

Can't imagine isolation,

Can't consume -

I die.

DIE.

CONSUME.

Have to consume,

Consume everything,

Like a black hole,

Otherwise you don't matter.

CONSUME!
