05/05/25

i lay down in the hollow,
and the earth embraces me,
with a lover' arms—
until the earthworms come.
they do not knock.

maggots whisper lullabies
in a thousand tiny mouths,
and still I sleep,
unmoved by their accolades.

my ribs become scaffolding
for pale mushroom towers,
my lungs a cradle for spores
who call me home.

flesh sloughs off like wet silk,
slick and sweet-smelling—
to the flies, at least.
they are drunk on my unraveling.

and oh,
the moss—
the way it kisses bone,
like it remembers who I was
and wants to keep me warm.
