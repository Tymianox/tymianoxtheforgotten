Death - my love

Please embrace me -

I'm too cold

You're my only safe space 

Do you wish for me to join you already?

Do you not want me to survive a few more day?

Do you not want me to push through for a few more years?

Because I do not. I don't want to hurt anymore

But I cannot go without your consent
