![[the hayworth tarot - ace of cups.jpg]]
It was the first, the womb, the vessel

Birthing all that the Cups know 

And it seeked

And it writhed

Alive and foul

And it bled into earth

And it seeped into sky

And from it the Cup Court arise

  

The Cup King called it a gift

The Cup Queen called it a curse

The Page and Knight only drank
