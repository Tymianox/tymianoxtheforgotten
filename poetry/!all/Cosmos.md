07/10/24

Lost in the shadows of my thoughts

Today's a night with no moonlight

Floating like a lonely astronaut

Forgotten in the emptiness of space

  

I seek solace in the shining stars

But fog rolls in and veils their eyes

Each breath a silent plea for calm

Yet nothing stirs beneath the skies
