![poem-human_condition](../!art/poem-human_condition.png)


it is the human condition to lie, maim, and kill  
to claw and ravage with ruthless will  
kindness is a myth made by those on the outside  
a tale told with none to say otherwise  
  
the species rotten to the core  
with hatred simmering forevermore  
the darkness hides under our skin  
but it seeps through, toxic waste that it is  
  
we smile with teeth that gnash and grind  
we cover blind rage with fleeting masks  
compassion's ghost is fleeting, rare  
it takes a monster to truly show care  
  
we are beasts in disguise  
even worse than some animals  
we tear at flesh to find some light  
but only shadows fill our sight  
  
victims of the human condition  
prisoners of our nature - our fate
