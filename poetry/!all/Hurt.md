![[poem-hurt.png]]

I hurt myself today  
To see if I still feel  
I focus of the pain  
The only things that's real  
The blade leaves a scarlet line  
Along my cracked skin  
Try to force compliance from by body  
But I still remember nothing  
  
I wear my crown of thorns  
In my prison of mirrors  
Full of endless thoughts  
I cannot begin to bear  
Beneath the stains of time  
Everything slips away  
You are not like me  
I am unlike anybody else  
  
What have I become, am I not a monster to you?  
Everything I know, fades away one day  
And you will have it all, my house of cards  
I will let everyone down, I will everyone hurt
