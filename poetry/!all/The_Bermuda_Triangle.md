Stranded strangers
In an indifferent world
Full of dangers
Towards us hurled

We're looking through
Detached empty crowds
Finding only a few
Cold hearts and warm tongues

Even if it was never meant to be
We'll still find ourselves
If we search through debris
In the never-ending sea of thieves

And after we find each other
Our estranged souls
We can be lonely together
Filling our painful holes
