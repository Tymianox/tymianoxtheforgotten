28/01/25

From endless nothing we come

Created or not matters not 

Exist we only to suffer

To slowly descend into madness 

And chaos

  

We cling onto hope

Cursed beings that consciousness gained

Hope, sex & love keep us alive

And if we lack those 

We slowly die 

  

Lovely. Pointless existence 

If only we could use it how we want

Not crushed by rules of our ancestors

If only we could live life to the fullest

Not forced to toil on this earth forevermore

Whether we choose to live or not is ultimately our choice. There is no ultimate answer, but that makes it even harder to find your own. So for now I will sit here undecided; waiting, observing, thinking. It feels wrong to not have an answer, not knowing my own thoughts, but that is yhe only choice I have in this. So come sit with me under the starlit sky.
