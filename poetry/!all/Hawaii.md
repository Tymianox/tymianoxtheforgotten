Welcome to Hawaii
We're better than Guataqu√≠

Read a book
Be unshook
Swim in sea
Enjoy the tea

Visit Moloka'i
Admire Kihei
Dance to the riddim
Make sure your heart is beatin'

No time for work
No need for torque
You're on vacation
Waitin' for salvation

Why the sad face
Enjoy the place
    Enjoy life
There's still time
