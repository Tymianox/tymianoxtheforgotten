are you lost

in the abyss filled with stars

are you lost

in the abyss of your mind

or are you lost

in the smoke of this dumpster fire

coughing, choking

surrounded by ash

are you fighting to escape

the chaos we call life

or are you embracing it

letting it consume you

and spit out anew

odin's ravens curse you:

ｂｅｃｏｍｅ，　ｏｒ　ｂｅ　ｎｏ　ｍｏｒｅ
