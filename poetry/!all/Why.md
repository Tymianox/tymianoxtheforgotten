Why is life so hard sometimes?
Is God testing my heart per chance?
Or is it just my good ol' bad luck
Oh, for Pete's sake who gives a fuck

Life is just an endless battle
Against every single debacle
And no matter how much you try
You'll always end up asking why

It's like you're stuck in a dark hole
And you can't find your way out
No matter how much you scream and shout
You're still stuck in there all alone

So why is life so hard sometimes?
Is it just because we're human?
And there's nothing we can do about it
But keep on fighting and hoping?
