Stop lying to yourself
Stop deceiving your heart

You mean something
You're not useless
Your life matters

Should life torture you
You must not give up
There are people
   Out there
Who need your help

There's so much more
You can achieve
If you don't give up

I am sure you'll find
What you seek
Be it peace
   Friends
Or justice

The only requirement is
That you don't ever give up
