Hello, my dove
I think I'm in love
Love on first sight
To be exact

You walked into my life
And I knew right away
That I wanted to be with you
For the rest of my days

I can't imagine my life without you
You brighten up every day
And I can't wait to spend forever with you

Hello, my love
I think I've fallen for you
And I don't mind at all

Thank you for being you
And making me feel so alive
I can't imagine my life without you

Hello, my sweetheart
I think I've fallen in love
And I don't mind at all
