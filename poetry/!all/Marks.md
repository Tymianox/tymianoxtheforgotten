Every human wants to
Leave a mark, no matter
How big they are or
How small they were

A childs handprint on the wall
A sentence "this is high" on a rock
A burned pot burried in a yard
A cherished shirt kept in a chest

A suspenceful counting on a wall
A tired rambling on the margins 
A drunks dick jokes in a book
An "I was here" on a monument

they all lived
they all loved
they all laughed
they all cried
they all left a mark
they all wanted
to be remembered
