Rip and tear
Until the day,
They find a way
To bring back Her.

Then thee will rip
Out thy heart,
And give it to Her.
Thee will tear
Away thy worries,
And bunny hop out
Like thee didn't end,
All of Hell.

In threescore
Or so years,
In the welkin
Thee shall live,
Thee will find
Your vesture;

And thee will remember,
How they killed Her.
How then thee slayed
Thousands of them.
And how you said farewell,
To demons,
And humans.
