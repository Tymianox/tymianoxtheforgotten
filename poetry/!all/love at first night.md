28/12/24

  

I saw you in the darkest depth

hiding from humanity's reach

though a myth, unseen by mortal eyes

yet in you my reality lies

  

your eyes - twin abyssi

in them I get lost tonight

laying on the moonlit duff 

as your hands leave thy mark on mine

  

your touch first - a chill

then it a fire starts

in ecstasy I writhe

yet do not escape your grasp

  

in the forest two shadows lie

only to then become one

a tale of love, forbidden lust

too strange to be heard by man
