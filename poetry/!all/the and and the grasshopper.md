the frivolous grasshopper 

begs the ant for food now 

all day he wanted to play

cause winter's far away 

and now he's starving

begging for a scrap of bread

the realistic ant refuses 

it warned him of his future

and it only is prepared 

for it's own survival

and that's why grasshoppers live a measly year

while an ant can live for decades
