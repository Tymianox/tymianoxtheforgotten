I must go in, the fog is rising,
A black cat's gaze, in silent twilight seizing,
Reflections dance in the enchanted night,
Where secrets stir with whispered magic chants.

In the stillness, shadows quietly call,
The moon's embrace, a mystic maul,
As if the world beyond were but a dream,
Where hidden wonders in the silence swim.
