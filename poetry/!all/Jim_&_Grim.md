Best pals, Jim and Grim,
Two sides of the same coin, one dim.
Jim with his secrets, locked away,
People captive, in his basement all day.

Grim with his scythe, reaping souls,
Bringing death, fulfilling his role.

Together, they walk a different path,
With Jim, hiding from the aftermath.
And Grim, with a scythe, ready for the call,
In the world of the living, he stands tall.

No judgment, no questions, just frienship,
In this world, so rare, like good parentship.
Though different, their bond remains strong,
For best pals will always belong.

So here's to the best pals, Jim and Grim,
A friendship like no other, with each other's limb.
