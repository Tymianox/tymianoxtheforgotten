Wouldn't it be great to stop existing?
To simply go out like an old light,
to be replaced by a new one soon?

To hear the screeching of tires suddenly
cutting off.
To smell metallicity of blood mixing with
burnt rubber.
To see your vision fading to black,
like a movie coming to an end,
with a tinge of red.

And then,
just go to sleep
in the eternal night
with no dreams
nor nightmares.
