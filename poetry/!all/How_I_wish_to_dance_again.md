02/02/25

Once under a mistletoe

With all the winds singing odes

A musing came upon me, when

I was lured into a glen

  

From behind a tree stepped out

A frame jovial and yet stout

It said Baldr was it's name

And called to a swing arcane

  

Frivolous and free of pain

This rite had no place for bane 

We had danced my fears away

It all seemed a bit too gay

  

Then Baldr fell to my feet 

His cheeks no longer beet

By a blind man killed 

The one who could not be stilled

  

I jump awake, all in sweat

In sight not a silhouette

Now to return to haunts of men

How I wish to dance again
