The queen of Cups

Mother of the kingdom

The one who feeds 

The one who loves 

She keeps everyone together

Spills all of the love and kindness

For the kingdom to drink

And thrive

To be strong

To do no foul

Drink the blood dripping off her fingers

Worthy are gifted with life

Sinners' only gift is death

Praise the Queen who gifts us life

Vow that sin will not know you

  

Pentacle Queen calls her

Wand Queen calls her

Sword Queen calls her

Yet she only cuts and gifts

  
  

Cup Queen calls her empty
