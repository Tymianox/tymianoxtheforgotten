You ask me sometimes,
Why I've gone numb
And depersonalized.

I walk still at first,
But in midstep -
I suddenly reflect,
Turn around, say aloud:

You know why,
I've told you each time;
I gave you so much time,
You knew what would come.
Just... go already!
Don't torture me with you!
I'll survive without you!
Just as I used to!
.
.
.
.
Why stay by my side,
When you hate what I am?
Why ask these questions,
When you know the answers?
Just leave me alone;
I'll deal with it on my own...

I think it's my right to be hellish,
When I warned you before.
