Ever since mankind
Discovered flames
All else was maligned
None else it blames

After millions of centuries
God was fed up with us
He sent Uriel to decimate
While he rained down flames
And cast down lightning upon us

And all we could do was kneel
And all we could say was "Please"
And all we could feel was the heat

And then it was over

And we were left with only
The ashes of our former selves
And the guilt of our collective sin
