In echoes of laughter I stand, eerily still  
Warmth already faded, pale white skin  
Face - a blur, like dreams slipping away  
And here I stand, unbothered, yet guilty anyway  
A heart, once vibrant, now - a barren field  
  
I search for love in this cracked heart  
But I know it all spilled long ago  
Nothing is left in its place—  
No piece fits the broken puzzle  
Nowhere to keep the grief, so it spills  
Yet again
