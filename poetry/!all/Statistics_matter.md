I don't want to become a statistic
I want to be someone
Someone worth being known
Someone to be remembered

I want to be somebody who made a difference
In the lives of others
I want to be somebody who was always there
For somebody else

I don't want to be just another number
I want to be somebody special
I want to be somebody who was loved
And who loved in return
