O! The Devourer Of Lasagna
O! The Lazy One
O! The Torturer Of Jon

O! The Eternal One
O! The All Eater
O! The Hatred Of Nermal

O! The Despise Of Mondays
O! The Great Comedian
O! The End Of Odie

Hear our prayer
Let us join you
In the paradise
Where lasagna
Never ends
Where Monday
Never comes

Who dares to call upon me?

O! The Greatest One Of All
We dare to call upon You
To anxiously ask for Your help
For we have heard stories
That no one who asked You
Was rebuffed by Your Greatness

Foolish mortals! Have you no brain?
Do you think that I would let live
Someone who disappointed me?

Of course not The Wisest One!
.
.
.
What is your request mortals?

O! The Greatest One Of All
We dare to call upon You
To ask for the best lasagna
For we want to experience
The unimaginable pleasures

Fools! Who do you think I am?
A fucking genie of a hundred wishes?
Has your intellect degraded so much
Through this thousand of years?
Had your species devolved so much?
Have you lost all your self-preservation?
Have you grown too proud to do anything?

O!...
I remember Jon.
He was different.
I came to like him.
Yes, I toyed with him.
But I enjoyed his company.
He wasn't like other people.
He didn't have a meaning in life.
Yet he lived on, just an average Joe.
He fascinated me, with his pathetic existence.
I wanted to know what kept him going even when others gave up.
I wanted to know what made him different, I wanted to know what made him be this way.
I...
I never discovered that.
As his brain started to decay I made one last ditch effort to find it...

But it was all for nothing.


Go away before I come to my senses and kill you!

Imbeciles!

Poor Jon...
