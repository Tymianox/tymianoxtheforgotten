All animals have
A symbolism they bear.
Lions are brave,
Foxes are sly,
Owls are intelligent,
Elephants are wise.

But humanity embraces them all.
It connects with every species
And learns from them,
Both good and bad.
And with them brings
A constant fight,
Between virtue and vice.
What will win?
Who will survive?
Only time knows,
What the result becomes.
