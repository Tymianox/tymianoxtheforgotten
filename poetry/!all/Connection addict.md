You got me addicted to connection

And now I can hardly cope

With the void I live in

There are no sparks

No thoughts

Empty lands

They reach beyond the horizon

I cannot comprehend how far they reach

And I can't see how I lived before

Oh, I know it's wrong

But I wish we'd never met

So I didn't have to feel this pain

This needle driven deeper and deeper

And twisted and turned

By hand of god
