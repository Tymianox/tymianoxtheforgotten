I'm so excited〜
My first mission!
So that's him?
Pathetic.
He don't stand a chance.
Mission start!
Uh oh.
Out of focus
Look out, he's got a knife!
Damn it! Bastaaaard!
Murder in broad daylight!
What you gawkin' at?
Kablamo!
Ehehe, that was a crit!
Pretty colors!.
Ugh, it got on my dress.

What is this music?
Bangin'!

Boom! Headshot! 
Boom! Headshot!
BOOM!
HEADSHOT!
I missed, oopsie〜<3
Look at all that blood!
Such a nice shade.
That splash looks like a unicorn!
So much gore!

Daijoubu!

That's clean-up crew's problem〜
