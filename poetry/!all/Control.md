Wires in place of veins  
I’ve forgotten how to feel  
The world outside is fading  
Nothing here is real  
  
Tethered to a hollow void  
Every movement’s not my own  
In empty silence I kneel  
A marionette, alone  
  
The light is dim, the air is cold  
I wonder where I’ve gone  
I am a shell, a hollow doll  
Lost inside this game
Alone
