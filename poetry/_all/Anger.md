Gods are angry
Because of our sins 
They sharpen their teeth
For our puny 𝘷𝘪𝘦

Zeus readies bolts
Odin sent out his crows
Vulcan hammers blades
For queens of spades

Loki breaks chains
Artemis starts hunts
Neptune seas disturbs
For the disdains


And down comes; The
Wrath of all the gods
With it destruction
For human wads

And in the chaos
Loki carpe diem's
Thanking the Makers
For our poor heads

Let's wait for death
In our smoking homes
The End's starting
No praying'll help
