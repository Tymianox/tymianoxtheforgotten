Yes you're right.
There is someone
Behind it all,
But it's not
The Illuminati,
Nor the masons
Or some reptoids.

It's a huge organization,
Named the **S C P** Foundation.
And their mission?
It's quite simple:
Keep all humans
From panicking,
And anomalies
From trafficking.

What they hide
Inside their belly?
Might a question
In you appear.
Let me see into
The Archive:
A poem's in making.

######   (SCP-682)
We've got a reptile
Not so docile,
Whose existence
Ceased be not,
It's body - battered
More than martyrs,
And it's hatred
For us - people
Is bigger - than it's ego.

######   (SCP-106)
A World War One solider,
Feeds on your fear.
He'll make you
Pray, beg & scream.
He can dissolve walls,
And hop inside
His own dimension.
Now that I think of it,
Isn't it just IT?

######   (SCP-4001)
Somewhere in Egypt
A building stands,
Filled with books
Of all width and size.
But just open one,
You'll see,
There's no fiction
Within.
It stores all our life's
As stories to be read.
But beware
Couse that's not all.
Do not try to bring
Ink within.
All stories
Can be changed,
And rearranged.

######   (SCP-173)
A concrete statue
Kills with virtuosity.
You look away,
It snaps your neck
Back into its place.

######   (SCP-105)
Iris and her Polaroid
Will take you a photo,
Only to slap you by it
For breaking her limit.
Please don't try to
Force her to killing,
She's just a kid
Without her kin.

######   (SCP-6757)
In Site-██ a deck of cards is,
Consciousness it has.
It'll take over your body
And make you a magician goodie,
For a price of not knowing it.

######   (SCP-963)
Doctor Jack Bright,
Once a human being
Now a restless soul.
Traveling from body to body,
Without experiencing
The sweet release of death.

######   (SCP-426)
I am a toaster,
Always has been
And will be.
You don't wanna experience
My secondary effect,
Unless you want
A suicidal death.

######   (SCP-531)
A pair of cats,
Staring in their eyes.
If you break their contact
You'll become one.

######   (SCP-4661)
Los Angeles
The City of Sin.
Demons created it
And demons will,
Make it scream.

######   (SCP-3515)
Weeping willows
Are known to be sad.
But this one will make you
Terrified.
It'll send you to your
Childhood house,
But deep underground.
You'll be stuck
In a loop,
Digging up -
Dying in a stoop.

######   (SCP-3003)
Deep in space
A planet resides.
It's inhabitants? Humans,
Controlled by parasites.
They desire to claim
The Universe whole,
We can stop them
For now...

######   (SCP-1678)
Under London
UnLondon lies,
A mirror copy,
Only more
Steam-punk.
Be careful
Bobbies are around,
They don't need a reason
To beat you to a pulp.

######   (SCP-1867)
Lord Blackwood,
A great adventurer
Turned sea slug.
Explorer of Victoria,
And ancient Amon-Iram.
Messenger of the Forest,
Hunter of the Tarasque.

######   (SCP-1281)
A fusion of man 'n' machine
With a message of great gravity
Asking us politely
To make the galaxy shine brightly
From life's glare

######   (SCP-558)
A number of lenses
That'll expand your senses:
Microwave is Red,
UV is Violet,
Contrast is Green,
Achromatic is Gray,
And if you're brave enough
You can wear Black
Which let you will
See the End of all.

We fight in the dark...
So you can live in the light.
