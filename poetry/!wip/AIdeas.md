And as the great conflagration
Raged and burned
All of our cities and all of our homes

The righteous were spared
And taken to heaven
While the wicked were consumed
In the lake of fire



He burned us with his ire
And we have cried out in pain

How long, O Lord, must we wait?
How long will you keep us in suspense?
When will you finally act?
Your wrath has been raging against us
For far too long!

Your anger has consumed us
Until we are nothing but ashes
And our souls are parched
From the heat of your wrath

We have cried out to you
In our hour of need
But you have not answered

Why have you forsaken us?
Why are you hiding from us?

Is it because of our sins?
Is it because we are not worthy?

We are tired of running
We are tired of hiding

We just want to be free

From the flames of your wrath
