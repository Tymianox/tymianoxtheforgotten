i saw mourners at my funeral
and wondered if you would 
come to my grave 
with baby blossoms
the flowers with no scent
the ones that live 
longer than others
but you never did
and for a moment 
i got scared
because what if 
you collapsed
i wouldnâ€™t be 
able to live
with you gone
then i remembered 
i was already dead.





I saw a funeral with no one there
no mourners, only a priest with a cold face
and thought "why's no one here?
why's no one mourning their death?
were they that undeserving of farewells
or flowers on their grave?
or a simple prayer to send them off to hell?
and then I looked at the plaque
it was mine
I was dead

I saw mourners at a funeral
gathered, crying and weeping
and thought "who are the flowers for?
who're they bidding farewell to?
who could it be? who is dead?
who had such impact on their lives?
who is deserving of their prayers?
and then I looked at the plaque
it wasn't mine
you were dead
