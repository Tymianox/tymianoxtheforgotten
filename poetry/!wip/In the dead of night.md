The moment I pressed on the handle, my psyche was flooded with images of people - people with no meaning in life.

Then a ghost popped up in front of me and acted as a therapist. Yep, that's it. Pretty anticlimactic isn't it?





In the dead of night
spine-chillin' fright
in a sickly shed
can be heard.

One evenin'
of the year '99
I found meself 'fore
it's wooden door
with no remembrance
of my there wand'rance.

In a momentous surge
of prowess, my urge
to open it's doors
quickly outpours.

In a moment
my life's current
was around turned.

Once I moved the handle
my senses were like a candle
blown out in a whim.

My psyche's urn
was filled with worn
images of people's lifes
full of shameless lies.

My senses numb
I stand my ground
against the mysteries
of the forgotten histories.

When my senses come back
I see inside humanoid figures
Sitting around a bloody pentagram
