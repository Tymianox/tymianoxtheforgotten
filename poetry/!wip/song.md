"I woke up choking. I spat up seawater and blood, like I’d been drowning. After catching my breath, I sat there for a moment, coming to terms with this strange world I was in. There wasn’t enough for me to determine whether what I was experiencing was reality or a dream or something in between. Even though I had been coughing up seawater, I was certain that I had suffered a panic attack. And that’s what had put me out. 

Even then. I was still surrounded by the mirrors. My ears were still ringing. But I know I was no longer hearing that voice. Its voice. The scythe was also gone, initially. It took some more navigating the mirror maze until I finally found it again. But it was different. The blade was now covered in blood. And a gruesome smell was beginning to grow. I was done playing this game, whatever it was, and I swung the scythe out to destroy the mirrors.

When the glass shattered, it was as if I was lifting the curtain on some macabre stage show. I nearly fainted a second time when, beyond the rubble of glass shards, I saw the pile of corpses at the far end of the room. Standing among the bodies was … a pony that looked just like me. Yet, it couldn’t have been a reflection. It moved on its own and resembled me only uncannily. 

It spoke,

“murderer. murderer. murderer,” it paced, gripping its own bloodied scythe.

“MURDERER,” it raised its voice and pointed the blade towards me. The blood trickled down from the tip of the scythe, dripping down and seeping into the lifeless bodies.

The bodies. They all seemed to be larger, more considerably sized equine creatures. Every single one of them had been decapitated. Every cut was clean and precise, and appeared to have been accomplished in one single stroke. Though, the heads were nowhere to be seen. 

“i have become creekflow. though i always was,” it spoke, moving slowly towards me, “this is your slaughter.”

I still felt like I was coming to my senses. I was dazed and confused. In that bewilderment, I lunged out at Creekflow and swept my scythe out towards it. The blade of my scythe met its own, as if it had been anticipating my attack. I leapt backwards and hurled my scythe at it. The tip of the blade initially appeared to hit Creekflow, but as this happened, it dissolved into countless flower petals.

The petals landed gently upon the corpses, decorating the carrion in another shade of red. They appeared to be the petals of wild roses. Those didn’t grow around here."
