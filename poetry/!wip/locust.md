Writing Prompt `#_580`
In the near future, genetically-modified locusts who have been designed to swarm continuously escape a laboratory and ravage farmlands across the Earth. The world is slowly dying, but you find a way to survive by growing crops indoors with plant growing lamps and solar panels. The windows and doors of your house are boarded up, but you can still hear the swarm outside as they try to find a way into your home to eat what is left of the world's vegetation.

in order to stop them from decimating farmland. I mean... ok, that seams reasonable, but I can't shake the feeling that something will go wrong... maybe I watch to many movies.

Journal Entry: Day 1

It's been a week since the locusts got out of the lab, and already it feels like the end of the world. The swarm is everywhere, devouring crops and leaving nothing but barren land in its wake. The news reports say that governments are working on a solution, but I'm not holding my breath.

I'm lucky, I suppose. I've got enough food to last me a while, and I live in a remote area far from the epicenter of the outbreak. But I can still hear them buzzing outside, trying to get in. The windows and doors are boarded up, but I know it's only a matter of time before they find a way in.

I've started growing crops indoors with plant growing lamps and solar panels. It's not much, but it's something. I've always been interested in gardening, and now it's become a matter of survival.

Journal Entry: Day 10

It's been ten days since the swarm arrived, and I've had to barricade the doors and windows even more. They're getting more persistent, trying to find any way in. I can hear them scratching and scraping, and sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy.

But I've managed to grow some crops. It's not much, just a small patch of lettuce and some herbs, but it's enough to keep me going. It's strange, but in a way, I feel more connected to the earth than ever before. I'm constantly monitoring the temperature and humidity, making sure everything is just right.

Journal Entry: Day 30

It's been a month since the swarm arrived. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out. I've heard reports that they've started attacking buildings, chewing through concrete and steel. If they can do that, what chance do I have?

But I'm still here, still alive. I've managed to grow more crops, and I've even started experimenting with different varieties. I've got some tomatoes growing now, and some peppers. It's amazing how much you can learn when you're forced to adapt.

I can hear them outside, louder than ever. But for now, at least, I'm safe. I've got my plants, and I've got my solar panels. I don't know what the future holds, but I'm going to keep fighting as long as I can.
