The day was gloom and dark, clouds reigned in the sky, as the cold wind caressed dying leaves. The streets lay empty - without a soul nearby, only wavering streetlights flickered, sending distress calls in Morse code. The walk home had blurred into a fleeting vision, lingering only as a phantom after waking. For weeks it felt as if the world itself had grown weary, lethargy creeping like a silent ill, apathy selling in.

At last, he found himself stood at the door, yet it's familiar frame felt like a threshold to another realm - dimly lit, cold, as if touched by winters hand. He stepped inside where silence ruled in absence of life, and a chill settled into his bones as he fumbled with the thermostat. He threw his weathered rucksack onto the bed, uncaring, and turned on a hot shower. For a brief, unsettling moment, the edges of reality seemed to blur, and a strange detachment sank in, as if he were drifting in a space where time unraveled and self dissolved.

With the shower finished, he stepped out into the cool air and dressed quickly, eager to chase away the lingering shivers. It was time to eat. Leftovers from the night before didn’t sound so bad—at least, no effort they required. He drifted through the kitchen, his movements slow, and stared blankly at the microwave. Minutes ticked by without him even realising, time leaking away like water down the drain.

He killed the lull by reaching for his phone, scrolling through social media, numbly absorbing the curated lives of others. Yet even this seemed distant, as if his mind was wrapped in fog and his senses could only grasp at faint echoes of reality. And there it is again, a shadow, dark and flickering, right on the edge of his vision. It clung to the dim corners of the room, an omen of things he'd rather not think about, dissipating before he could look at it. A chill crawled up his spine—*ding*. The foods done. Each bite tasted bland, a texture more than a flavour, and he found himself chewing mechanically, barely noticing as the food disappeared from the plate.

The weight of the day seemed to press in around him. The house was too quiet, too still, as though it held its breath in anticipation. The air felt thicker, somehow, as if it resisted his every step. He turned on the television, hoping to dispel the oppressive silence, but the sound seemed muted, as though swallowed by the walls. Shadows in the room seemed to stretch and tremble, shivering at the corners of his vision. He could almost hear something, singing? Just beneath the hum of the static.

He focused on the screen, but the image seemed distant and unreal. The figures moved in jerky motions, like marionettes dangling from unseen strings. His eyes began to ache, his vision blurring at the edges. He tried to look at the time, but his body refused to obey, rooted in place, demanding that he stare at the screen—demanding that he watch.

A knock at the door, postman's here, a bit late today. Nothing for him, as usual. He took his headphones, cranked up the volume and drifted away to sleep, his dreams filled with dark shapes, hoarse voices and poetry of all things.
