Tommy Vercetti 
Roll up in that red chevy
Hit em with the Danny Trejo,
That’s my Machete
I leave ya guts leaking out your body like some spaghetti 
Hail Mary, pray for ‘em
I don’t think that they ready for this!
Aye you know you done fucked up, right?
Ring the alarms
Cos the DAEGHO the don 
Causing a ruckus, uh!
Running amuck
Welcome to armageddon
Oh yes, I mean every harm
Y'all manipulated like puppets   
By these motherfuckers kicking it in parliament office
So now I’m
Running through the jungle
Broke my leash just like an animal
Don’t get up in my way 
I’ll slap the teeth right out your mandible
I know my flow too hot
But that's something I can’t help lil bro 
I’m spitting way too much Fuego
Yeah young DAEGHO way too flammable 
Fuck around, you’ll meet the reaper
If you step in my area
Repercussion, misdemeanour 
Oh my god!
I might be um pouco loco
Trust my hunch, no Quasimodo
Lone wolf, I was born a Lobo
Fuck you thought?
I don't waste no time 
When there's murder on my mind 
Keep that 30 on me, quickdraw 
I submerge him in the fire 
Ain't no blur between these lines 
I watch him burn until he fry 
Put him in a fucking urn and then we hurl him in the sky, uh!
Retribution, restitution
This the Outcast revolution
Free your mind from the illusion 
Kill corruption and collusion
Deceiving you from the news
Believing the anti truth
Ain’t no freedom in sight
Propaganda leave you blind 
Wha uh uh uh oh


Aye aye aye
Yuh, tell me will it ever get better or will I just go in circles
I think I’m going nonverbal
My brain keep spazzing out 
Tell me will I suffer forever
I keep on leaping these hurdles 
But still keep tripping in dirt 
Will my pain be lasting now
For the rest of my life
Everybody wanna see me in a ditch, alright
That’s why I walk with a knife
I could never even trust once, so I gotta think twice
All I want is my peace
Sometimes I feel like I cannot breathe
I ain’t feeling no ease
People wanna be the one I want, but they not who I need
Architect of light, but I’m coming from the darkness
Ones who don’t even know a thing about me gon’ talk shit
Hard to be my friend when I know I truly scare you
Hard to speak my mind when I feel I need to prepare you
Fuck them eggshells, I’m a walking landmine
Inner peace or relief for some reason I can’t find
I been looking all around and everybody fucking sucks
I won’t give you none of my time if you undeserving of my trust
It would be nice for a second
If I could catch my breath and
Stop thinking about how death can
Take us from off this planet
I wish I was different
But I’m so fucking twisted
I used to not be this fucked up, I kinda fucking miss it
