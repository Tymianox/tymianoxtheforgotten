Man obscures nature but nature fights back and takes over Man

  

Without nature Man is nothing but nature without Man is everything

  

Neither man nor nature care about you so you don't worry about them

  

Only nature does miracles but rarely are they good

  

People pretend to respect the dead but the dead don't need their respect

  
  
  

I mean no disrespect

But mankind deserves no respect

They know no compassion even for their kind

Don't compare me to yourself

I'm no human but a monster

But still kinder than you
