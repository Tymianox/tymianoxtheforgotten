Finally after 10 years of living in constant fear with millions dying a torturous, long death, someone found the nuclear codes. Nothing can beat dying from THAT, even thinking about IT is painful. We had to watch our friends and family scream "make it stop" over and over again, while their faces twisted in unimaginable ways. No doctor, no scientist, no priest could do anything about it. It is time to destroy the plague of humankind.

Goodbye humans.
Welcome nanomachines.
