Recovered audio log from a mobile device that emerged from SCP-1437.


##### Day 1  
  
It’s been a week since the lab breach. Not “a breach” as if it were some contained mistake. No. It’s a tear — a gaping wound in the world, spilling out a swarm that devours everything it touches. The scientists called them “engineered specimens.” Now they’re calling them “biological disasters.” But that doesn’t matter. Nothing matters except what’s left of the land, stripped bare and hollow, a Swiss buffet for these locusts to feast upon.  

I’ve sealed the doors and boarded the windows as best I can. The buzz is faint tonight, just a whisper on the wind, like a warning. They’re closer than I want to admit, their presence pressing on the walls, testing for weaknesses. The sound is strange — like the hum of some machine winding down — except there’s nothing mechanical about this swarm — at least I think so. The air feels thick with their presence, almost sticky. 

I’ve started growing a small patch indoors, using the last of my seeds. Lettuce, onions, carrots, potatoes, a few herbs. Nothing substantial, but it’s something. Out here, so far from the outbreak, I might just be safe.
  

##### Day 3  
  
They’ve come. I caught a glimpse of one today, pressed against the slats of wood covering the front window — a hulking locust, bigger than should be possible. Its carapace was an oily, iridescent green that shimmered with a sickly sheen. Its eyes… were the worst part. Massive and blank, but it seemed like they were seeing not just my house but me inside it. The faint outline of my own face reflected in its eyes, as though it was already memorising my shape.

Its legs scraped against the boards in a rhythmic beat, like some warped kind of Morse code. I wanted to turn away, but I couldn’t. It felt as if, in that moment, we were connected. It lingered there, motionless, for what felt like minutes before it flew back into the darkness, swallowed by the buzz. 
  
The lettuce is growing in small, tight knots, the leaves curling in on themselves. I don’t know if it’s a mutation, or what, but it doesn’t matter. They’re getting closer, and I need every scrap I can grow.  


##### Day 4

I can’t explain it, but sometimes, the buzz outside sounds almost like laughter, low and guttural. They’re feeding. And I’m trapped here, waiting to be next.  
  
  
##### Day 7  

The buzz is starting to get to me. Always there. I can hear patterns in it. They almost sound like a baby trying to speak. It’s invading my thoughts. 

They are everywhere.


##### Day 9

Outside, the swarm has grown louder, clawing and scratching, more insistent with each night. I swear they’re testing, probing every crack in the boards, every inch of my defences. The patterns in their hum have become eerily similar to words now. But they’re just on the edge of comprehension.
  
  
##### Day 11

The swarm left yesterday, at least most of it, they seem to leave “spies” behind. Do they have some sort of hivemind?
  
Whatever they are — or what they brought with them, it’s spreading inside. The crops have taken a sickly turn, sprouting dark veins that pulse under the light. The lettuce leaves are growing thin, twisted, their veins dark like ink. Even the air in the room feels tainted now, heavy with the smell of mildew and damp earth. I eat anyway. What choice do I have?

Sometimes, when I touch the walls, I feel something… pulsing back, faintly, like a heartbeat. Or maybe I’m imagining it.


##### Day 15

Today, I managed to catch a broadcast. The signal was weak, barely audible above the swarm’s ceaseless hum, but I strained to listen.  
  
The voice was cracked, worn down by fear, a hollow echo. “This is an e—*phsshshk* broadcast *shhhhk* population of Blackthorn Hollow *krrrk* lost to the *mmmrrrrrwss*. No survivors found. Estimated one hour to *shrrrt*—oy entire town *hsssssss* locusts moving south, unaffected by barrie—*chhhhhh*”  
  
For a moment, I thought I heard screaming in the background, raw and frantic, before static swallowed it. The broadcast cut off as abruptly as it started. But the words burned themselves into my mind. *No survivors… entire town… in an hour.*
  
They aren’t just eating crops anymore. They’re hungry for anything organic, anything alive.  
  
  
##### Day 23
  
A month. I’m not sure if anyone is still broadcasting. Last I heard they said these locusts can chew through concrete and steel, and from what I hear outside, that seems almost tame compared to what they’re doing now. I can feel them, pressing in closer every day, their buzzing louder, heavier, as though it’s wrapping around the house itself.
  
The plants are barely holding on. The lettuce has grown brittle, leaves shriveling to thin, dark husks. I try planting more, but everything is warped, rotten before it even sprouts. It’s as if the locusts have tainted the very air. Also the solar panels seem to be faltering, struggling to hold any charge.  
  
Tonight, as I lay in the darkness, I could have sworn I heard them say my name, woven in the hum of the swarm. A voice that was mine but not mine, echoing from the walls, the ceiling, the floors. I can feel them in here with me, even if I can’t see them. They’re... aware of me, somehow, watching from every shadow.  

  
##### Day 26
  
The swarm is continuing to devour my world. I caught a glimpse of them from afar through a gap in the boards — a writhing mass of bodies, undulating, weaving together with a kind of choreography that felt intentional, almost ritualistic. Their eyes… I can’t shake the look in their eyes. There’s no reason they should have eyes that seem _aware_, that look through walls, through darkness, as though seeing not just me, but beyond me, as though I am a lens in a vast, unblinking eye.. I think they’re... learning. Evolving. And I’m the subject of their study.  
  
The crops are no longer edible. They’re soft, rotten at the core, filled with blackened veins and strange fungal growths. When I touch them, they feel wrong, like dead flesh that hasn’t realised it’s dead. But I eat them. The hunger gnaws too fiercely to care anymore.  
  
The buzzing has shifted — deeper, like a heartbeat drumming through the walls. And the words... they’re clearer now, threading through the hum. They say things I can almost understand, words I can’t grasp but feel. They’re telling me they’re close, that they’re waiting for me to give in, to let them inside.  
  
  
##### Day 29  
  
There’s nothing left. They’ve consumed everything outside, and I — somehow — remain, we’ll see for how long. The boards tremble under their weight, the walls groan with their pressure. I hear their voices now, clear and relentless, filling every crevice of my mind. They say my name, again and again, weaving it into a tapestry of hunger and patience.  
  
The last crop withered days ago, leaving only a blackened husk. I don’t even bother with the solar panels anymore — the sky has been darkened by their mass, blocking out the sun. I can feel them, like a pulse beneath my skin, vibrating with each beat of their wings.  
  
They’ve found a way inside. Or perhaps they were never truly outside to begin with. They’ve invaded not just my house, but my thoughts, my senses. I see them when I close my eyes, when I try to sleep. Even now, I can feel them, inching closer, shadows flickering along the walls, their whispers louder than my own thoughts.  
  
I don’t know how much longer I can resist. They’re here, surrounding me, pressing closer. And I am just one more body for the swarm.


##### Day 30

I’m leaving.

What’s the point of survival?

I don’t know what they have become. It’s as if they are not eating just the world, but everything related to it? How do I explain this? Like the concepts of things disappearing? Like they are not only eating matter but also the very essence of everything.

I feel as if they are already eating me, just from the inside. They are constantly repeating my name. It feels like they’re waiting for me to let go, to step outside, to become a part of… whatever they are.

I can’t take it anymore.

I want this to end.

They can have the world for themselves.
